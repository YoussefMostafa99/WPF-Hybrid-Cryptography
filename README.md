-Link to Package used within the Program:

https://github.com/myloveCc/NETCore.Encrypt


-Before you run the program install the package first using 
the NuGet Package Manager Console in Visual Studio (Tools> NuGet Package Manager> Package Manager Console) 
 by writing the following code:

Install-Package NETCore.Encrypt -Version 2.0.9


If by any chance this didn't work I will include a self-contained 
executable file.
